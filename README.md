Some userscripts to use with Greasemonkey

## Disable YouTube Polymer (last update 2020-11-06)

~~Disable YouTube Polymer adds a `?disable_polymer=true` at the end of every YouTube URLs.  How long will it last before Google decides to break everything?  God only knows.~~

As of late 2020, Google killed it.  We're stuck with Polymer.

## Old Reddit (last update 2020-05-21)

Similar to the YouTube script, this changes every Reddit URLs so `reddit.com` becomes `old.reddit.com`.  That's because the new Reddit sucks.

## Sensible Instagram (last update 2020-11-06)

Do you know another website that sucks?  Instagram.  Now, when you're not logged in and are scrolling through a profile, it will block everything with a hideous modal asking you to log in.  I'm not, Instagram, get over it.  This script removes the modal and re-enable scrolling.  It will probably be the most updated script since the people working for Instagram are mad lads and like to change CSS classes.
